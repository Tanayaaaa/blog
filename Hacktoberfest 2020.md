## HacktoberFest 2020: A Virtual Meetup 

**"Hacktoberfest 2020-The Open Hack Day”** is a coding event arranged by WebMob Technologies for the geeks of technology development services. It is an excellent platform to showcase unique expertise and to establish a network with peers who develop some of the most advanced products and solutions for WebMob Technologies.

Yes, it's pandemic, and so we all colleagues were not together to celebrate it under one roof this time. And keeping all the official guidelines in mind, we thought why don’t we celebrate it over a video call, I mean virtually? After all, now-a-days video calls have become part of our daily chores either it’s with your client, team, or family. 

The fun part of celebrating Hacktoberfest in Webmob Technologies is that we don’t only encourage our teammates to send 4 pull requests but we also like to learn something new and out of the box from our brilliant colleagues.

So, Team Developers were busy attending the workshop on “3D Basic, Model, Texture, Lighting, Scene” and sessions on “Advance React Concept” and “Neuralink and the Brain Magical Future”. In-between they were also trying their hands at sending all the 4 PRs. Yes, our developers are very dedicated and hardworking!

While our Team Management was enjoying the sessions on “Digital Content and New Generation” and “Space Tourism”. And also gave a try to blog writing.

Our day doesn't end here yet! What an event if you don’t have some fun at the end? We all had a good time playing games like:
###### Know Your Colleague:
We secretly collected the childhood photos of our team and displayed the photos one after another where as the team was supposed to guess who is who. So entertaining!
###### Live Quiz:
I personally loved it! It was fun brainstorming and answering the quizzes asap. Beacuse the one who asnwers the first scores the point.
Yes, we were allowed to google search the questions but the questions where such that if was difficult to even find on google.  
###### Scribble.io:
Playing this game was too fun as we got to know the best drwaing skills of our collegues, the hidden talents!

And trust me, not even for a single moment we felt like we all are not together. Because all we had is a good internet connection! Just kidding:p

With all these exciting sessions and fun activities, HacktoberFest 2020 came to an end, but with the hope of coming back in 2021! Till then stick around and stay healthy!
